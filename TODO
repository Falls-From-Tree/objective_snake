To Do List:

  CRITICAL ERRORS:

  BUGS:
    Attribute modifiers not totally filled in for choose_gem, choose_era, and
      choose_diamond

  SUGGESTED CHANGES:
    Make BaseGem helpers throw an error if passed the wrong type:
      Example:
        BaseGem.add_PP('bleh')
        $ ValueError
      Maybe do this by forcing type of param?
